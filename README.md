## Spotify-Recommendation
# This is my attempt on building a Spotify Recommendation portal that uses user input to generate a Spotify playlist.
I will be using Spotify's API. I do not know what I am doing currently, but will learn. 

# I have learned
I just discovered an unbelievable video by *codingforentrepreneurs* and have used it as my guide for the client development.
Now its time to talk to the API and gather information for the Logistic Regression model.
