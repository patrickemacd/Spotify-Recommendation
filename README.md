## Spotify-Recommendation
# This is my attempt on building a Spotify Recommendation portal that uses user input to generate a Spotify playlist.
I will be using Spotify's API. I do not know what I am doing currently, but will learn. 

# I have learned
I just discovered an unbelievable video by *codingforentrepreneurs* and have used it as my guide for the client development.
Now its time to talk to the API and gather information for the Logistic Regression model. 

My friend will (who is very cool) just taught me git!

I will be using a lot of dictionary comprehension in order to go through the JSON that I retrive from Spotify...let's see how this goes...
